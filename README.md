# Attention-Based Neural Networks for Sentiment Attitude Extraction using Distant Supervision

This repository provides a source code of models and related experiments, conducted as a part of the following paper:

* Attention-Based Neural Networks for Sentiment Attitude Extraction using Distant Supervision [[ACM-DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3405962.3405985)
    * Rusnachenko Nicolay, Loukachevitch Natalia
    * WIMS-2020

## Dependencies

* Python-2.7
* arekit-0.20.0

## Installation

* **Core library installation:** All the implementation depends on
core library for *sentiment attitude extraction*,
dubbed as [**arekit-0.20.3**](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit/blob/0.20.3-wims-rc/README.md):
> **NOTE:** it is important to download in ``arekit`` directory.
```
# Download arekit-0.20.3
git clone --single-branch --branch 0.20.3-wims-rc https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit arekit

# Install dependencies
pip install -r arekit/dependencies.txt
```
* **Resources**: Since **arekit-0.20.0** all the resources such as collections
(RuAttitudes, RuSentRel) and lexicons
(RuSentiLex) are a part of the related library.

* **Word2Vec**: installation assumes to run a ``download.sh`` script:
```
cd data && ./download.sh
```
